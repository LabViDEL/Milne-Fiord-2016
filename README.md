# Milne-Fiord-2016
DNA was extracted and sequenced from water samples (size fraction: 0.02–0.22 um) from the water column of the Milne Fiord Epishelf Lake, Nunavut, Canada, in 2016. Metagenomic data was assembled into contigs that were identified as viral using VirSorter and VirFinder (vOTUs). For detailed methodology, see Labbé et al, in press.
